## Accessibility Standards

To help optimize the site for visitors and search engines:
* Div elements have been replaced with semantic elements to demonstrate each section's significance.
* Heading elements follow a logical order to demonstrate the significance of each section.
* Site images have been given alt attributes for SEO purposes, as well as providing descriptions for screen readers, 
the visually impaired, and potentially blocked images.
* A functional navigation bar has been added to decrease scrolling for visitors.
